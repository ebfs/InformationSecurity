## Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations

*	Terminology:
    *	Sender and receiver: The two parties between sending a message.
    *	Plaintext: Unencrypted text.
    *	Ciphertext: Encrypted text.
    *	Cryptography: Science of securing messages.
    *	Cryptanalysis: Science of decrypting secured messages.
    *	Authentication: Ensuring that the sender is the expected and true sender.
    *	Integrity: The receiver should be able to verify that the message has not been tampered with.
    *	Cipher: Cryptographic algorithm, a mathematical function that is used to encrypt and decrypt.
*	Restricted algorithm:
    *	The algorithm is secret and unknown.
    *	No quality control or standardization.
    *	Popular for low-sec applications.
*	Key:
    *	All possible values of key are in keyspace.
    *	Security of algorithms that use keys are based in the key.
*	Symmetric algorithm:
    *	Both sender and receiver have the same key.
*	Asymmetric algorithm:
    *	Sender has public key, receiver has private key.
    *	One-way communication.
*	Cryptoanalysis:
    *	Ciphertext-only attack:
          * Using examples of ciphertext to break the cipher.
    *	Known-plaintext attack:
          * Using examples of plaintext and ciphertext.
    *	Chosen-plaintext attack:
          * More powerful than known-plaintext.
          * Using specific plaintext to discover the key.
    *	Adaptive-chosen-plaintext attack:
          * Using smaller blocks of plaintext that and can be changed to other plaintext to yield results.
    *	Chosen-ciphertext attack:
          * Use different ciphertexts and has access to the decrypted plaintext.
          * Primarily used to attack public-key algorithms.
    *	Chosen-key attack:
          * Using knowledge about the relationship between keys to break the cipher.
    *	Rubber-hose cryptanalysis:
          * Using intimidation tactics to get the key.
*	Standard beginnings and endings can be known to the cryptanalyst.
*	Publicly known algorithms are the best and are still unbroken.
*	Given time and money, commercial security programs can be broken.
*	Given time and money, algorithms can be reverse-engineered.

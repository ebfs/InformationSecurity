    *	Cryptography: Science of securing messages.
    *	Cryptanalysis: Science of decrypting secured messages.
    *	Authentication: Ensuring that the sender is the expected and true sender.
    *	Integrity: The receiver should be able to verify that the message has not been tampered with.
    *	Cipher: Cryptographic algorithm, a mathematical function that is used to encrypt and decrypt.
*	Restricted algorithm:
    *	The algorithm is secret and unknown.
    *	No quality control or standardization.
    *	Popular for low-sec applications.
*	Key:
    *	All possible values of key are in keyspace.
    *	Security of algorithms that use keys are based in the key.
*	Symmetric algorithm:
    *	Both sender and receiver have the same key.
*	Asymmetric algorithm:
    *	Sender has public key, receiver has private key.
    *	One-way communication.
*	Cryptoanalysis:
    *	Ciphertext-only attack:
          * Using examples of ciphertext to break the cipher.
    *	Known-plaintext attack:
          * Using examples of plaintext and ciphertext.

          * More powerful than known-plaintext.
          * Using specific plaintext to discover the key.
    *	Adaptive-chosen-plaintext attack:
          * Using smaller blocks of plaintext that and can be changed to other plaintext to yield results.

## Frequency distribution in Finnish:

According to https://www.sttmedia.com/characterfrequency-finnish this is the frequency distribution in Finnish:

## Password manager Dashlane:

https://www.dashlane.com/

### What threats does it protect against?

Identity theft, password theft.

### What information is encrypted? What's not?

Passwords, financial, medical, & private info, and attached encrypted files like passport scans.

### What's the license?

"a. License. Dashlane grants you a personal, non-exclusive, revocable, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable license to download and install the Apps in object code format on one or more devices (as permitted by your plan), for your personal use. The license includes the right to (i) access, use, and make a reasonable number of copies of any published descriptions of the functionality, technical requirements, or use of the Services (collectively, “Documentation”), and (ii) use any changes to the Apps made available to all users of such Apps at no additional cost (each an “Update”) when each Update is made generally available. Updates may be installed automatically or require installation or approval by you. Failure to install an Update may result in an App or the Services not functioning correctly." https://www.dashlane.com/terms [accessed 16.09.2023]

### Where is the data stored? If in the cloud, which country/jurisdiction/companies? If on local disk, where?

Amazon AWS. Amazon AWS has datacenters in the US, Sweden, Brazil, Spain, Germany, Italy, France, the UK, Israel, South Africa, Bahrain, UAE, India, Australia, China, South Korea, and Japan.

### How is the data protected?

Assymetric encryption, SSO certification, zero-knowledge architecture. Without SSO certification, the user uses a 'Master Password', although while researching it became unclear where this Master Password is stored locally.

Public Key is stored by Dashlane on their servers, Private Key locally on user's app.

## Cracking ciphertext:

Looking at the cipher we can already make some assumptions based on what appears to be a website link at the end. Substituting DHHP as HTTP gives us some clues about what the cipher might be. To avoid confusion, everything that is red is untranslated and everything translated will be highlighted green.

D = H

H = T

P = P

Next, there are two paths we can consider. Going for two-letter words or assuming that the end of the website link is either COM, ORG, or NET. Both paths have the least amount of variation. The second word presumably ends in ‘T’, so how many two letter words do we have that end in T?
IT and AT.
Since the first word can’t be ‘THIT’#’, we can assume the word is ‘THAT’S, and the second word ‘IT’.

M = A

T = I

B = S

The next thing that grabs my attention is the two three-letter words that end in II. If we look at possible words that start with S and are followed by two of the same letters, there is only one possibility.

I = E

SUNSTITUTIWA is likely to be SUBSTITUTION. I first considered SUBSTITUTING, however the KWU wouldn’t make sense, and it becoming YOU does.

U = U

N = B

W = O

A = N

K = Y

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/142781925/268470715-455f471e-6e28-44f2-9822-ce8f63dfd357.png)

AAAJKSIS is likely to be ANALYSIS.

OOG is likely to be COM as ORG nor NET fit.

SIGPJE is likely to be SIMPLE.

YOU'YE is likely to be YOU’RE

A = N

J = L

K = Y

Y = R

O = C

G = M

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/142781925/268470716-4162d749-2a2d-4ec2-a206-5d01388750a2.png)

NOR = NOW

OSSICIALLY = OFFICIALLY

COQEBREALER = CODEBREAKER

BRWLEN = BROKEN

SREEUENCY = FREQUENCY

And using these assumptions we can crack the whole code.

R = W

S = F

Q = D

L = K

W = O

E = Q

11.28AM – 12:02AM
34 minutes to break down. I had a strong assumption that the link would be terokarvinen.com, but I felt that would’ve made this a bit too easy, instead focusing on the other parts of the cipher.

## Encrypt and decrypt a message.

For this task I chose to use GPG4Win/Kleopatra. In essence, it does everything that we did in class with GPG, only with a user interface. Using GPG4Win/Kleopatra, I can write, encrypt, and decrypt messages using the built-in notepad, or alternatively import files to be encrypted/decrypted. To simplify this task I will be using the built-in notepad.

I've now created my key pair, and will be using it to encrypt and decrypt my message.

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/142781925/268472654-25f569c7-92a9-44dd-a671-cf78fa42a847.png)

Here I can encrypt my message.

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/142781925/268472655-124d5f2c-9bd7-4ef0-90d3-0e36f5b03679.png)

Wonderful! It's now in ciphertext.

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/142781925/268472656-2d2a3955-158a-4f7e-859e-a01566d7bc6a.png)

Now that text can be copy and pasted and using the decrypt action it automatically knows which key to use as the key exists in my library of keys, and deciphers the original message.

### Shavers & Bair 2016: Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser;

#### Introduction

* Tor is modified from Firefox.
* True IP is hidden using Tor.
* Easy to use, simple, free.

#### History and Intended Use of The Onion Router

* Tor is intended for anonymous communication.
* Allows connection to censored sites.
* Tor isn't illegal. Users can engage in illegalities as they could on clearnet.
* Developed originally in 2002 by US Navy.

#### How The Onion Router Works

* Tor uses relays between sender and receiver.
* Elliptic curve cryptography - unbreakable with current resources.
* Composed of first relay, middle relay, exit relay.
* First relay does not know about exit relay.
* Middle relay does not know about sender and receiver.
* Exit relay does not know about first relay.
* Routes are randomized and change roughly every 10 minutes.

#### Tracking Criminals Using TOR

* Some success due to capitalising on errors made by suspects.
* FBI was able to use an exploit in Firefox to identify an illegal service. This has since been patched.
* Biggest weakness is the user itself:
  * Accepting geolocation.
  * Changing base settings.
  * Using plugins.
* Owning and using nodes to track traffic:
  * Nodes are regularly rotated.
  * New entry nodes are initially ignored to reduce threat of compromised entry nodes.
  * Even if traffic is tracked, it's still encrypted.
* Ross Ulbricht:
  * Founder of Silk Road.
  * Used personal information on clearnet, was linked to his darkweb identity.
* Eldo Kim:
  * E-mailed bomb threats to Harvard staff.
  * The timing of the e-mail coincided with his use of Tor.
  * Eldo Kim admitted his actions when questioned by FBI.

## Installing TOR
 
Let's install Tor Browser! This should be simple enough. We can find the download from https://www.torproject.org/download/

Here we can see Tor browser can be installed on various operating systems. For this exercise, we will go for the Windows executable.

Now that that's downloaded, let's run the .exe.

Choose the language and the location.

And that's that! Simple as. No coding, no overly confusing process, no nothing.

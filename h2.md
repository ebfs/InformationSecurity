## OWASP Top 10: 2021
The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) lists and breaks down the top 10 computer security threats every year and ranks them based on the severity of the threat. In this summary, we will be looking at threats A03, A05, and A06.
### A03: 2021 – Injection
*	Injections have been ranked down to third place since 2020.
*	Average chance of incidence at 3%.
*	Almost 300,000 occurrences.
*	Examples of injections include XSS and SQL injections.
*	Applications are at risk when:
    * User given data is not properly vetted.
    *	Dynamic queries (queries updated every time it is run/used in certain modules) are input directly into SQL interpreter software.
  * Hostile data is used: 
    * In object-relational mapping used to cross-reference sensitive data.
    * Directly.
*	The concept of injection does not change among interpreters. The methodology remains the same, although the language used differs.
*	OWASP encourages automated testing of headers, URLs, cookies, JSON, etc. to minimize the risk of injections.
*	Prevention:
* Use [where applicable] a safe Application Programming Interface (API). The benefit of this is avoiding using an interpreter.
* Use positive server-side input validation.
* In essence, this means that certain input is allowed, and a list of blocked inputs are automatically considered invalid. Allowlist input validation has certain inputs allowed, and all other input is rejected.
* Server-side input is safer than client-side input. Hostile actors may bypass input validation in client-side input.
* SQL controls within queries to prevent data leaks.

### A05: 2021 – Security Misconfiguration
*	Security Misconfiguration has risen from 6th place to 5th on the OWASP Top 10.
*	Average incidence rate of 4%. 
* Slightly over 200,000 occurrences of a Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE). CWEs are a category for vulnerabilities in computer systems. Aptly named, ‘Common’ implies that these are unextraordinary. 
* Applications are vulnerable when:
* Ignoring proper security hardening. Security hardening involves minimizing a computer systems vulnerability by minimizing the number of possible attack vectors. Without security hardening, applications are more vulnerable to security misconfiguration.
* Using or allowing unnecessary features on the application. In a way, security hardening by blocking or uninstalling these features reduce possible attack vectors.
* Using default credentials [U:admin P:password, as an example, do NOT do this!].
* Providing highly informative error messages to users. These may provide the information an attacker needs to perform their attack.
* Disabling or improperly configuring security features
* Not updating software. Not updated software are prone to security threats as they do not have the latest vulnerabilities patched.
* Prevention:

### A06: 2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated components
* Systems are vulnerable when:
* Unaware of all client & server-side components.
* Component versions are not up to date.
* Software is legacy and unsupported; meaning that there are no new patches or versions for the software.
* Sysadmin is unwilling or incapable of scanning for vulnerabilietes in used components.
* Sysadmin doesnt fix/upgrade components in timely intervals. (In large intervals/gaps in updates, the system is at risk of exploits)
* There is failure in testing compability
* Using faulty configs.
* Prevention:
* Removing or uninstalling unecessary components.
* Using official, legitimate builds/signed packages.
* Monitoring that which has been left unmonitored.

### Own thoughts:
By and large, many security issues derive from incompetence or inaction to update and plug possible entry points. A safe (although never foolproof) environment is built on vigilance.

# h3: Should Tero wear a helmet?
## Summaries:
### Braiterman et al 2020: Threat modelling manifesto
*	The function of threat modelling is to recognize vulnerabilities within a given system.
*	Thread models benefit from the 4-question model.
*	Threat modelling should be used as it reduces risk. It allows us to identify vulnerabilities and opens discussion on how to remove or minimize the risk presented by vulnerabilities.
*	Threat modelling allows us to prepare for mitigation in future designs.
*	The manifesto is a guide and should be used in ways that best fit the userâ€™s needs.
*	The manifesto follows two guidelines: values, and principles.
*	Values:
    *	The manifesto values discovering and mitigating problems, rather than looking at a checklist and moving down the checklist accordingly.
    *	A human element that involves cooperation.
    *	Action over inaction.
    *	Repetition.
*	Principles:
    *	Early threat modelling is the best case scenario.
    *	Threat modelling aligns with the needs and capabilities of the organisation.
    *	Understandable to stakeholders.
    *	Communication and documentation.
*	The manifesto introduces us to patterns that are either beneficial or detrimental to threat modelling:
	  * Beneficial:
          * A systematic approach in which knowledge and structure enhance threat modelling.
          * Informed creativity.
          * Collaboration in which many views and ideas can be shared to enhance the threat model.
          * Using proper tools.
          * Applying known theory into practice in order to benefit from previous iterations.
    * Detrimental:
          * Lone-wolf mentality.
          * Focusing on the problem rather than the solution.
          * Focusing on small modules rather than the entirety of the system.
          * Focusing efforts on a singular model rather than variations.

# h3: Should Tero wear a helmet?

## Summaries:

### Braiterman et al 2020: Threat modeling manifesto

*	The function of threat modeling is to recognize vulnerabilities within a given system.
*	Thread models benefit from the 4-question model.
*	Threat modeling should be used as it reduces risk. It allows us to identify vulnerabilities and opens discussion on how to remove or minimize the risk presented by vulnerabilities.
*	Threat modeling allows us to prepare for mitigation in future designs.
*	The manifesto is a guide and should be used in ways that best fit the userâ€™s needs.
*	The manifesto follows two guidelines: values, and principles.
*	Values:
    *	The manifesto values discovering and mitigating problems, rather than looking at a checklist and moving down the checklist accordingly.
    *	A human element that involves cooperation.
    *	Action over inaction.
    *	Repetition.
*	Principles:
    *	Early threat modeling is the best case scenario.
    *	Threat modeling aligns with the needs and capabilities of the organisation.
    *	Understandable to stakeholders.
    *	Communication and documentation.
*	The manifesto introduces us to patterns that are either beneficial or detrimental to threat modeling:
    *	Beneficial:
          * A systematic approach in which knowledge and structure enhance threat modeling.
          * Informed creativity.
          * Collaboration in which many views and ideas can be shared to enhance the threat model.
          * Using proper tools.
          * Applying known theory into practice in order to benefit from previous iterations.
    *	Detrimental:
          * Lone-wolf mentality.
          * Focusing on the problem rather than the solution.
          * Focusing on small modules rather than the entirety of the system.
          * Focusing efforts on a singular model rather than variations.

### Shostack 2022: Welcome to the Worlds Shortest Threat Modeling Course

* Goal of videos are to introduce threat modeling
* Why threat model?
    *	To anticipate problems when is cost effective to deal with problems.
    *	Allow us to think about security early on so we can design a sytem to be as secure as it needs to be.
* Four-question framework:
    *	What are we working on? (Diagram)
    *	What can go wrong? (Identify threats)
    *	What are we gonna do about it? (Mitigation)
    *	Did we do a good job? (Validation)
* Sketching in threat modeling:
    *	The initial phase of 'what are we working on' and how we can engage other people with that question.
    *	Allows us to visualize 'what can go wrong'.
    *	Non-permanent.
* Record your threat modeling:
    *	More concrete than sketching.
    *	Allows us to look back and learn new things.
    *	Recordkeeping is great! So many benefits that it would be foolhardy to list them all.
* Data flow diagrams in threat modeling:
    *	Heavy association to threat modeling.
    *	Simple to draw, easy to use.
    *	Include:
          * Pointy corners: Things we are unable to have control over.
          * Round corners: Things that are under control.
          * Arrows: Data flows, how things are connected.
          * Drums: Storage devices.
          * Dotted boundries: Trust boundries, environments in which things are operated. Different trusts.
    *	Example of data flow diagram:

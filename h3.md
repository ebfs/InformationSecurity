# h3: Should Tero wear a helmet?

## Summaries:

### Braiterman et al 2020: Threat modeling manifesto

*	The function of threat modeling is to recognize vulnerabilities within a given system.
*	Thread models benefit from the 4-question model.
*	Threat modeling should be used as it reduces risk. It allows us to identify vulnerabilities and opens discussion on how to remove or minimize the risk presented by vulnerabilities.
*	Threat modeling allows us to prepare for mitigation in future designs.
*	The manifesto is a guide and should be used in ways that best fit the userâ€™s needs.
*	The manifesto follows two guidelines: values, and principles.
*	Values:
    *	The manifesto values discovering and mitigating problems, rather than looking at a checklist and moving down the checklist accordingly.
    *	A human element that involves cooperation.
    *	Action over inaction.
    *	Repetition.
*	Principles:
    *	Early threat modeling is the best case scenario.
    *	Threat modeling aligns with the needs and capabilities of the organisation.
    *	Understandable to stakeholders.
    *	Communication and documentation.
*	The manifesto introduces us to patterns that are either beneficial or detrimental to threat modeling:
    *	Beneficial:
          * A systematic approach in which knowledge and structure enhance threat modeling.
          * Informed creativity.
          * Collaboration in which many views and ideas can be shared to enhance the threat model.
          * Using proper tools.
          * Applying known theory into practice in order to benefit from previous iterations.
    *	Detrimental:
          * Lone-wolf mentality.
          * Focusing on the problem rather than the solution.
          * Focusing on small modules rather than the entirety of the system.
          * Focusing efforts on a singular model rather than variations.

### Shostack 2022: Welcome to the Worlds Shortest Threat Modeling Course

* Goal of videos are to introduce threat modeling
* Why threat model?
    *	To anticipate problems when is cost effective to deal with problems.
    *	Allow us to think about security early on so we can design a sytem to be as secure as it needs to be.
* Four-question framework:
    *	What are we working on? (Diagram)
    *	What can go wrong? (Identify threats)
    *	What are we gonna do about it? (Mitigation)
    *	Did we do a good job? (Validation)
* Sketching in threat modeling:
    *	The initial phase of 'what are we working on' and how we can engage other people with that question.
    *	Allows us to visualize 'what can go wrong'.
    *	Non-permanent.
* Record your threat modeling:
    *	More concrete than sketching.
    *	Allows us to look back and learn new things.
    *	Recordkeeping is great! So many benefits that it would be foolhardy to list them all.
* Data flow diagrams in threat modeling:
    *	Heavy association to threat modeling.
    *	Simple to draw, easy to use.
    *	Include (DFD3 model):
          * Pointy corners: Things we are unable to have control over.
          * Round corners: Things that are under control.
          * Arrows: Data flows, how things are connected.
          * Drums: Storage devices.
          * Dotted boundries: Trust boundries, environments in which things are operated. Different trusts.
    *	Extremely crude example of data flow diagram:

   * Notation isn't that important as long as everyone understands what we are working on.
* What can go wrong?
    *	Heart of threat modeling.
    *	STRIDE/Kill chain/other models can help us find the answer.
* STRIDE:
    *	[S]poofing
    *	[T]ampering
    *	[R]epudiation
    *	[I]nformation Disclosure
    *	[D]enial of Service
    *	[E]levation of Priviledges
    *	These issues can happen in a myriad of different systems. Very homogenous.
    *	Possible issues that could be run into. i.e. What could go wrong? Can these happen?
* What are we going to do about it?
    *	Risk management: Accept or transfer risk?
    *	Do not ignore risks.
    *	Some things must be fixed. Some things simply can not be fixed.
* Did we do a good job?
    *	Would you recommend threat modeling to a colleague?
    *	Was the effort of threat modeling worth it?
    *	If the answer to both of these is no, then we can assume we did not do a good job.
 
### Shostack 2014: Chapter 1 - Dive In and Threat Model!

* What are you building?
    *	Diagrams are effective in presenting what is to planned to be built.
    *	Already in the diagram we can begin to think what can go wrong:
          * Is the web browser being used by those that have permission?
          * Repercussions if someone modifies data in database?
          * Can we ignore encryption?
          * Trust boundaries for things such as accounts, clients, VMs, organisations.
    *	The larger and more complex the diagram, the easier it is to miss entry points and vulnerabilities.
    *	One should ponder if the diagram is appropriate for the system being built.
    *	Attack surface: Larger entry points are easier to attack.
    *	Trust boundaries limit attack vectors.
    *	Both aforementioned are interchangeable.
* What can go wrong?
    *	Elevation of priviledge: Game to help in threat modeling.
    *	STRIDE to identify possible threats.
          * [S]poofing: Using someone else's identity.
          * [T]ampering: Modifying data that the user doesn't/shouldn't have priviledges to modify.
          * [R]epudiation: Claiming to have not something.
          * [I]nformation Disclosure: Breaking OPSEC.
          * [D]enial of Service: An attack that prevents the system from operating in normal capacity.
          * [E]levation of Priviledges: User being able to do something that they should not be able to do. i.e having admin priviledges.
* Identifying threats:
    *	Begin with outside actors. Move down the list of STRIDE.
    *	Do not ignore threats while focusing on other vectors. Document.
    *	Focus on feasible threats, not the impossible.
* Addressing threats:
    *	Once threats are documented, begin to identify counters:
          * Mitigation: Actions to make it harder to perform threat.
          * Elimination: Eliminating certain features so the threat cannot be performed.
          * Transfer: Moving the handling of the threat to another party.
          * Accept: Accept the possibility of the risk, and it's repercussions.
    *	Spoofing:
          * Using unique usernames.
          * Having a form of authentication.
          * Being careful with executable files.
          * Using proper file pathways.
    *	Tampering:
          * Files, memory, network data can all be tampered with.
    *	Repudiation:
          * Ensure that system logs are maintained, and safely stored.
    *	Information Disclosure:
          * Monitor the network to ensure no user is leaking data.
          * Monitor the network to ensure nobody is spoofing a trusted user and gaining access to data.
          * Use innocuous names for directories and files.
          * Access-control lists and cryptography.
    *	DOS:
          * Firewalls
    *	Elevation of Priviledge:
          * Wary of injections.
          * Control flow and memory corruption attacks use C-like languages to take advantage of weak typing. Type-safe languages such as Java or C# mitigate risk of these attacks.
* Checking the work:
    *	Validation is the last step of threat modeling.
    *	The model should answer the questions of is it complete/accurate/cover everything/allow for movement to next phase without making changes to the diagram.
    *	The diagram should be updated if the answer to any of the aforementioned is 'no'.
    *	Check if the solution to each threat is correct.

## Make-belief boogie-man: a threat model for an imaginary company.

Introducing Ebfs Oy Ab: an up-and-coming company that specialises in [REDACTED]. They have already secured contracts with government institutions within their home 'Blue Nation'. In this natal stage of their company, the higher echelons of the corporation and the engineers are considering threat modeling for their business. So, let's have a look at what they are going to consider while they are getting things up and running:

### Our Assets:

Within the system, we have the databases, servers, a switch, the clients, the admin's client, as well as connections to the internet. Ebfs Oy Ab handles different databases which handle customer data, employee data, product information. Immediately we can begin to predict what could go wrong with this configuration. 

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/142781925/266790245-309daa9b-388f-4760-bef0-d396107d8df2.png)

There are three key trust boundaries: One that encompasses the servers and databases, another that is limited to the clients/workstations, and lastly the sysadmin's personal client. The systems are local and no part of the network has been outsourced to cloud services due to extreme paranoia of the CEO (he wears a helmet in office).

The most valuable assets are our customer data, followed by our secret IPs in our product information database. Maintaining the integrity of our customer data is of utmost importance to ensure our customers maintain their trust in us.

### What can go wrong?

First, we will apply the STRIDE model.
* Spoofing: To ensure that there is no spoofing, all employees will be issued unique usernames, and have a two-step authentication process, which includes a password and an personal authenticator device which generates a random number. To spoof, the intruder must know the username, password, and possess the physical authenticator device, as well as be able to enter the company premisis. Vigilant employees will notice unauthorized personnel.
* Tampering: Due to the nature of the location of the databases, data could be tampered with as they are all accessible through the same method. This is an area where the system should be improved. Additionally, from the webpage there is pretty easy access to the databases. This could lead to possible injections to access otherwise hidden information.
* Repudiation: Logs are generated and stored on the system admins personal client. Backups are stored in case of catastrophic failure or mistakes.
* Denial of Service: Due to the local nature of the entire system, a dedicated DOS attack could hamper operations and limit the company from operating at normal capacity.
* Elevation of Priviledges: Employees have access to all databases within the network, and as such could potentially access information that they are not entitled to.

While Ebfs Oy Ab has done certain strides in assuring that only employees can access the network, there is a huge risk brought by the easy access to the databases through multiple attack vectors. The expected value of the probability of an attack on the databases, as well as the monetary value of losing our customers and their trust (thus impeding future commerce) is extremely high. The damages could easily be in the millions.

Maintaining the logs only in the possession of the system admin might prove problematic. While the chance of something going wrong is considered minimal, the cost is great. Do we act on this?

In addition to this, due to Ebfs Oy Ab being heavily involved with state actors of their home Blue Nation, the company could be targeted by malicious attacks from the rival 'Yellow Nation'. The Yellow Nation has known cyber attack capabilities that cannot be swept under the rug, and have been known to target similar companies that work with government facilities of Blue Nation. The Yellow Nation has the capability, we have given them the opportunity due to this security oversight concerning database access, and they certainly have intent due to worsened diplomatic relations over the years. In addition to this, cybercriminals looking to sell possible information of government clients to actors such as the Yellow Nation cannot be diminished.

### ~~We're doomed!~~ What are we going to do about it?

First, the entire system should be partitioned in a way that there are firewalls within every possible connection. Employees should be briefed on security hygiene as well as the weight of the risks discovered during the threat model analysis. Encryption will be employed were applicable. Encryption will help us mitigate network monitoring, file tampering, and certain methods of spoofing. The databases should be split from one another so that employees that lack access to one cannot enter another. Access-control lists will be vetted to ensure there is no oversights in permissions. Logs will be stored in another location in addition to the sysadmins personal client, and be protected and specified. The company will look into the possibility of relocating web services to trusted cloud services that can withstand denial of service attacks. To combat possible injections, there will be implementation of controls within queries to prevent data leaks, use positive server-side input validation, and utilize safe APIs and avoid interpreters. All software and OS will be updated as soon as updates are available. We will work with our government partners to ask for consultation on what they have done to mitigate risks (collaboration is key!).

### Did we do a good job?

Ebfs Oy Ab might avoid an immediate crisis, but the threat of one is never gone. Continious testing into vulnerabilities in the system network as well ass continuous threat modeling will keep the company vigilant.

## Answer to the question: should tero wear a helmet?

If it makes him feel safer, sure. But if you're not on your bicycle, perhaps take a step back and ponder whether or not it is necessary at the time to wear a helmet.

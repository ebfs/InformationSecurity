###  Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions

* One-way functions are simple to compute, but difficult to reverse.
* While seemingly impossible to reverse a one-way function, it simply boils down to resources available.
* No proof of 'true' one-way functions.
* One-way encryption isn't inherently useful as it wouldn't be able to be decrypted.
* Trapdoor one-way function:
    * Has a secret trapdoor (key) to compute the function in the other direction.
* With *x*, easy to compute function *f*(*x*).
* With function *f*(*x*), hard to compute *x*.

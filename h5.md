###  Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions

* One-way functions are simple to compute, but difficult to reverse.
* While seemingly impossible to reverse a one-way function, it simply boils down to resources available.
* No proof of 'true' one-way functions.
* One-way encryption isn't inherently useful as it wouldn't be able to be decrypted.
* Trapdoor one-way function:
    * Has a secret trapdoor (key) to compute the function in the other direction.
* With *x*, easy to compute function *f*(*x*).
* With function *f*(*x*), hard to compute *x*.

### Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions

* One-Way Hash Functions:
    * Many aliases: compression function, contraction function, message digest, etc.
    * Uses a variable-length input and compresses into a typically smaller, fixed-length output.
    * Input = pre-image, output = hash value
    * Many-to-one. Infinite input, limited output.
    * Hard to predict the pre-image for a certain hash value.
    * Used for verification/authentication.
* Message Authentication Codes (MAC)
    *

## Summaries

###  Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions

* One-way functions are simple to compute, but difficult to reverse.
* While seemingly impossible to reverse a one-way function, it simply boils down to resources available.
* No proof of 'true' one-way functions.
* One-way encryption isn't inherently useful as it wouldn't be able to be decrypted.
* Trapdoor one-way function:
    * Has a secret trapdoor (key) to compute the function in the other direction.
* With *x*, easy to compute function *f*(*x*).
* With function *f*(*x*), hard to compute *x*.

### Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions

* One-Way Hash Functions:
    * Many aliases: compression function, contraction function, message digest, etc.
    * Uses a variable-length input and compresses into a typically smaller, fixed-length output.
    * Input = pre-image, output = hash value
    * Many-to-one. Infinite input, limited output.
    * Hard to predict the pre-image for a certain hash value.
    * Used for verification/authentication.
* Message Authentication Code (MAC) / Data Authentication Code (DAC)
    * One-way hash function with a secret key.
    * Hash value is determined by the pre-image as well as the key.

### Särökaari 2018: Phishing through email

* Phishing: the act of sending an e-mail that appears authentic, with the goal of gaining information. May include malicious attachments or forwards to malicious sites.
* Why people fall for phishing scams (based on a study by BlackaHat 2016 with 1200 participants):
   * 34% curiosity.
   * 27% participants expected a similar email to come already and assumed it to be authentic.
   * 16% assumed sender was authentic.
* Using a common name is a good method.
* For 'ethical'/non-malicious phishing (e.g social engineering experiments), permission required, as well as within legality.
* Sender Policy Framework (SPF):
   * Email validation system.
   * Checks if sender IP is expected IP.
* Phishers can check if an organisation has valid SPF configuration, if not, the phisher can mask themselves as that organisation.
* DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM):
   * Email validation system.
   * Server provides a digital signature in order to authenticate sender/email transit.
* Domain Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC):
   * Uses SPF and DKIM records and provides reports if someone is trying to abuse the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA).
*  Using SPF and DKIM provides legitimacy to your domain.
*  Using SPF and DKIM a phisher can bypass email protection filters.
* Malware/Spam filtering:
   * Prevent payload from reaching receiver.
   * Prevent subpar phishing emails from reaching receiver.
* Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) attack vector:
   * Use Word document functionality to send data between apps.
   * Can bypass protections.
   * Doesn't require/rely on macros.
   * Executed code that would appear as a warning can be masked with a less 'alarming' message.
* URL whitelisting/web filtering
   * Allow only specific domains to be accessed within the intranet.
* Greylisting:
   * Greylisting is used to block mostly low-effort spam emails. Can be circumvented by sending the email multiple times.
   * Can be detrimental as it will also block trusted/expected, unknown sources.
* Site cloning:
   * Replicating existing websites to appear authentic.
   * Effective for efforts where the objective is to steal credentials.
* IDN Homograph attack
   * Using foreign characters in the website name to appear authentic.
   * gmaíl.com vs gmail.com
   * Fixed in Chrome, but not in FireFox.
   * Punycode is a provider for registering these domains.
* What are effective phishing delivery methods?
   * Fraudulent package delivery service.
   * Fraudulent mail from company servicedesk/IT department.
   * Fraudulent commonly used services such as LinkedIn, Gmail, etc.

* Inevitability of the click:
   * With just 20 emails in a phishing campaign, one click is largely guaranteed.
* Summary of mitigation:
   * Using SPF,DKIM,DMARC
   * Safe domains
   * Educating employees on phishing

## Hashcat Installation

The Debian 12 virtual environment is run on a Windows 10 version 10.0 build 19045 system. Below are some specs on the virtual environment:

 ![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/142781925/265199086-98ce3440-2c6f-400b-9c75-f39d42ffeef4.png)

Let's get to it. To begin, we will open the terminal in the virtual machine. 
Let's update all the apps, and follow that with installing haschat:


sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get -y install hashid hashcat wget


 ![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/142781925/270125131-ae2a3cf9-428c-4e8c-bc26-13729cddc533.png)

Second, a new directory for our hashcat stuff.


mkdir hashed

cd hashed

Third, we need a dictionary that hashcat can use to find hashes. For this we download Rockyou.
https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz


$ wget https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz

$ tar xf rockyou.txt.tar.gz

$ rm rockyou.txt.tar.gz

Great, thats hashcat all set up!

## Crack this hash: 8eb8e307a6d649bc7fb51443a06a216f

First, let's find out what kind of hash we are dealing with.

It appears most likely to be MD2, followed by MD5 and MD4. We will try with MD5 and work our way down the list of possible hash functions.

Look's like the plaintext was: february

## Gone phising.

### Evil email for the masses:

#### Part 1: The bait

So let's phish some facebook credentials because... I don't know, I'm bored. First, I'll send myself a 'forgot password' email to find out what their password recovery email looks like.

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/142781925/270130317-ee75494a-abe7-44c1-8332-6015b9ef8aad.png)
![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/142781925/270130319-fdd5c9c2-4760-4184-8531-403e42842faf.png)

Wonderful! I can use this as my template.

Now let's dissect this:
* First, rather than send a link to change the password, it provides a 6-digit code for the recovery service.
* It mentions my name and email, this makes it a bit difficult to replicate for my mass phishing scam example as each email sent would have to be unique.
* It provides two direct links.

For this phishing attempt to seem legitimate, I will remove the mention of the name and email so it appears as so:

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/142781925/270130320-c67785bb-2446-49a9-98e3-f74cca24f8e6.png)

We can keep the passcode for password recovery. This phishing attempt will bank on people assuming that someone is trying to access their Facebook, so they will click the 'change directly' link or the 'I didn't ask for a new password' link. Both of these links will be lead to a clone site of Facebook with an IDN homograph attack. The landing page will be identical to the Facebook log-in page. Once the credentials are in, it will store the input, and lead the victim to the real facebook login landing page. Ideally, the victim will think they did something wrong, and log in normally, not suspecting anything has happened. While some change their passwords on Facebook, they might not change their passwords on all their apps/etc, and this username/email + password combination can then be tried for other things like their email etc.

#### Part 2: The victims

Obviously we will need people to send this very dastardly email to. But where can I get a repository of email addresses? Well, it's possible to buy a repositoryu of email addresses but that is of dubious legality. Instead, what if we use an existing dictionary? Earlier we downloaded the rockyou file which contains over 14 million lines. Politely, I asked chatgpt to write a simple program that goes through each line of a .txt file and adds '@gmail.com' to each line. This can be repeated with @outlook.com and @hotmail.com to shore up 42 million possible emails. It is very unlikely that most of these emails even exist, but this can be done alternatively with a regular dictionary, or better yet, have another program that uses common first names and last names to compile a file with all possible combinations, and then use the 'add gmail' program that was generated for this devious plan.

#### Part 3: the execution

I can rely on ChatGPT again to write me a program that'll do the heavy lifting. Let's say a program that takes an email from our list of emails, and the email content it needs to send, and repeat until the list of emails are exhausted:

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/142781925/270130323-44aae6fe-fb22-4e79-87bb-d4291a4a749f.png)

With our phishing email and list of possible emails, and the program to run it, the plan is launched.  While the program runs, there isn't much left to do but wait. After all, after 20 emails, there'll be atleast one click.

## Summaries

###  Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions

* One-way functions are simple to compute, but difficult to reverse.
* While seemingly impossible to reverse a one-way function, it simply boils down to resources available.
* No proof of 'true' one-way functions.
* One-way encryption isn't inherently useful as it wouldn't be able to be decrypted.
* Trapdoor one-way function:
    * Has a secret trapdoor (key) to compute the function in the other direction.
* With *x*, easy to compute function *f*(*x*).
* With function *f*(*x*), hard to compute *x*.

### Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions

* One-Way Hash Functions:
    * Many aliases: compression function, contraction function, message digest, etc.
    * Uses a variable-length input and compresses into a typically smaller, fixed-length output.
    * Input = pre-image, output = hash value
    * Many-to-one. Infinite input, limited output.
    * Hard to predict the pre-image for a certain hash value.
    * Used for verification/authentication.
* Message Authentication Code (MAC) / Data Authentication Code (DAC)
    * One-way hash function with a secret key.
    * Hash value is determined by the pre-image as well as the key.

### Särökaari 2018: Phishing through email

* Phishing: the act of sending an e-mail that appears authentic, with the goal of gaining information. May include malicious attachments or forwards to malicious sites.
* Why people fall for phishing scams (based on a study by BlackaHat 2016 with 1200 participants):
   * 34% curiosity.
   * 27% participants expected a similar email to come already and assumed it to be authentic.
   * 16% assumed sender was authentic.
* Using a common name is a good method.
* For 'ethical'/non-malicious phishing (e.g social engineering experiments), permission required, as well as within legality.
* Sender Policy Framework (SPF):
   * Email validation system.
   * Checks if sender IP is expected IP.
* Phishers can check if an organisation has valid SPF configuration, if not, the phisher can mask themselves as that organisation.
* DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM):
   * Email validation system.
   * Server provides a digital signature in order to authenticate sender/email transit.
* Domain Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC):
   * Uses SPF and DKIM records and provides reports if someone is trying to abuse the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA).
*  Using SPF and DKIM provides legitimacy to your domain.
*  Using SPF and DKIM a phisher can bypass email protection filters.
* Malware/Spam filtering:
   * Prevent payload from reaching receiver.
   * Prevent subpar phishing emails from reaching receiver.
* Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) attack vector:
   * Use Word document functionality to send data between apps.
   * Can bypass protections.
   * Doesn't require/rely on macros.
   * Executed code that would appear as a warning can be masked with a less 'alarming' message.
* URL whitelisting/web filtering
   * Allow only specific domains to be accessed within the intranet.
* Greylisting:
   * Greylisting is used to block mostly low-effort spam emails. Can be circumvented by sending the email multiple times.
   * Can be detrimental as it will also block trusted/expected, unknown sources.
* Site cloning:
   * Replicating existing websites to appear authentic.
   * Effective for efforts where the objective is to steal credentials.
* IDN Homograph attack
   * Using foreign characters in the website name to appear authentic.
   * gmaíl.com vs gmail.com
   * Fixed in Chrome, but not in FireFox.
   * Punycode is a provider for registering these domains.
* What are effective phishing delivery methods?
   * Fraudulent package delivery service.
   * Fraudulent mail from company servicedesk/IT department.
   * Fraudulent commonly used services such as LinkedIn, Gmail, etc.

* Inevitability of the click:
   * With just 20 emails in a phishing campaign, one click is largely guaranteed.

# Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains 

## Summary

Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are a new domain of threats that threaten sensitive areas. APTs are able to circumvent traditional securities placed into networks. Traditionally, security measures are knowledgable of previous efforts and methods, and build their security capabilities upon previous attempts. The kill chain model offers insight into how an adversary performs an attack, and understanding the adversary allows us to identify our weak spots and reinforce them. Alternatively, we can also use the kill chain to identify our adversary and engage them. 

Each link in the chain leads to the next stage, and inability to succeed in any part of the chain naturally halts the progress of the chain, and the objective cannot be accomplished. The cyber kill chain presented in the paper is specific to intrusions, and contains seven stages: 

1. Reconnaissance: Gathering information, so we can identify what we want to attack, and how. 

2. Weaponization: Making the attack into a deliverable format. 

3. Delivery: Once weaponized, the delivery method is identified. Generally, the delivery methods are email attachments, physical USB devices, and websites. 

4. Exploitation: The attack targets and exploits a specific application or OS weakness. 

5. Installation: The attack is installed onto the exploitable system. 

6. Command & Control: Secure remote access on the targeted system. 

7. Actions on Objectives: The objectives set to be accomplished are acted upon.
